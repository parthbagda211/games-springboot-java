Question 2:

Suppose you have a UserService class and a UserController class in a Spring Boot application. 
UserService class has a getInfo() that prints some value. The UserController needs to interact with the UserService for user-related operations. 
Demonstrate the use of Dependency Injection in Spring Boot to wire the UserController with the UserService. Provide the necessary annotations for Dependency Injection in this scenario.

userService : it contaionsa method getInfo() and prints some users information.
userController : it dempends on userService via constructore injection. it has a method getUserInfo() that delegates to userService.getInfo().
